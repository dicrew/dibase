h1. [di]base – a small collection of JavaScript helpers

Currently, [di]base only contains a small function that initializes the global @di@ object and adds a proxy for the "Console API":http://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Console_API as @di.con@.

h2. Global object

The global @di@ object allows other modules to hook into the global namespace. For example, a module called _whatever_ can simply put its methods and other public pieces in an object stored in @di.whatever@.

h2. Console API proxy

The Console API proxy allows other code to always use calls like @di.con.log()@, regardless of whether the global @console@ object is actually available or not. If it’s not, simply nothing happens when any of the @di.con@ methods are called. You can also disable all @di.con@ method calls by setting @di.usecon@ to a falsy value.
